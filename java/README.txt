RAPLEAF DIRECT API
==================

For general information regarding the personalization API, visit http://www.rapleaf.com/developers/api_docs/personalization/direct. The personalization API's terms and conditions are stated at http://www.rapleaf.com/developers/api_usage.

The API is queried by calling any of the query functions belonging to the RapleafApi file. An example script, RapleafExample, is provided. The example script queries Rapleaf's database for an e-mail given to the queryByEmail function.

There are two different jars included. One (rapleaf-api-complete) bundles json.jar with the Rapleaf API. The other, json.jar from http://www.json.org lives in /java/lib.
